Germany, with its Energiewende policy, has achieved a higher current renewable penetration (46% in 2023), largely driven by wind power, including significant offshore development.  California, targeting 60% renewables by 2030, relies predominantly on solar power, both rooftop and utility-scale. While both regions utilize solar and wind, Germany emphasizes wind while California prioritizes solar.  A key challenge for California is maintaining grid reliability given the intermittent nature of solar power, a concern less prominent in Germany's more diversified wind-heavy mix.\n",

Technical risks include system failures and vulnerabilities, with the potential for even a small error to have devastating effects: \"A single flaw in AI could lead to catastrophic consequences\" (Document 2). Societally, AI-driven automation threatens widespread job displacement, with one study projecting that \"Automation may disrupt 30% of jobs by 2030\" (Document 3).  Finally, ethical concerns arise from the potential for biased algorithms to perpetuate and exacerbate existing inequalities.\n",
